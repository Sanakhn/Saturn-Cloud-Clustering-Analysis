# Saturn Cloud Clustering Analysis

## Overview
This project involves clustering analysis of cloud structures on Saturn using datasets derived from the Cassini Saturn Orbiter mission. The primary goal is to identify and analyze distinct cloud clusters and patterns using unsupervised machine learning techniques. The datasets, available in .txt format, were sourced from the Cassini missionâ€™s data repository: https://data.giss.nasa.gov/cassini/clusters/

## Technologies Used
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
